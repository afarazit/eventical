  <h4>Convenient out-of-game access</h4>
  <p>Use your favourite calendar app on the desktop or mobile. Outlook, Apple Calendar,
  Google Calendar, or phone's native - you choose.</p>
  <p>Times are adjusted and shown in your own time-zone. No more missed events!</p>

  <h4>Keep everyone in the loop</h4>
  <p>Having a single location for scheduled incursion runs, mining operations,
  or the occasional roam keeps everyone on the same page.</p>

  <h4>You're always in control</h4>
  <p>You decide who to share with - individual characters, everyone in a corporation or alliance,
  or the whole Universe. Sharing can be stopped at anytime.</p>
